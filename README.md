# ðŸ“– Welcome to MyKindle! 
Hi! I'm a book lover, so I decided to make my own version of **Kindle** from **Amazon**. Once there's not a **Kindle** website, only **mobile** and **desktop** versions, I'll be here delevoping it.

**Notice** that this project is far away from being concluid, so you can **follow me**, and keep track of what I'm doing here.

## ðŸ‘€ How can I see? 
Currently the website is **not** online, but you can check it out by **Downloading** this repository and opening the **index.html** file in your browser of choice.
