                    <h1>Tyrion</h1>
                    <p>The north went on forever.</p>
    
                    <p>Tyrion Lannister knew the maps as well as anyone, but a fortnight on the wild track that passed for
                        the
                        kingsroad up here had brought home the lesson that the map was one thing and the land quite another.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They had left Winterfell on the same day as the king, amidst all the commotion of the royal
                        departure,
                        riding out to the sound of men shouting and horses snorting, to the rattle of wagons and the
                        groaning of
                        the queen's huge wheelhouse, as a light snow flurried about them. The kingsroad was just beyond the
                        sprawl of castle and town. There the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and
                        freeriders
                        turned south, taking the tumult with them, while Tyrion turned north with Benjen Stark and his
                        nephew.
                    </p>
                    <p>It had grown colder after that, and far more quiet.</p>
                    <p> West of the road were flint hills, grey and rugged, with tall watchtowers on their stony summits. To
                        the
                        east the land was lower, the ground flattening to a rolling plain that stretched away as far as the
                        eye
                        could see. Stone bridges spanned swift, narrow rivers, while small farms spread in rings around
                        holdfasts
                        walled in wood and stone. The road was well trafficked, and at night for their comfort there were
                        rude
                        inns
                        to be found.</p>
    
                    <p>Three days ride from Winterfell, however, the farmland gave way to dense wood, and the kingsroad grew
                        lonely. The flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile, until by the fifth day they
                        had
                        turned into mountains, cold blue-grey giants with jagged promontories and snow on their shoulders.
                        When
                        the
                        wind blew from the north, long plumes of ice crystals flew from the high peaks like banners.</p>
